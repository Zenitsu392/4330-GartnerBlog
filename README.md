"By 2022, 70% of organizations that attempt to adopt microservices will have found the effort too disruptive and will have switched to miniservices instead."

Microservices can be challenging to implement despite their proven success at companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Twitter. It's important for business leaders to understand potential risks and costs before investing in them, as highlighted in a Gartner report.

-Require substantial technical and cultural changes

-"solid competency in agile and DevOps practices"

-Change how data is managed, because each microservice cannot share its data

-Needs to be developed with a product mindset: a focus on producing value for the customer

-Teams need to have significant autonomy in order to build an effective microservice

Require a complex application infrastructure for developing and deploying microservices

"Gartner suggests miniservices as an alternative to microservices for companies that may not have the prerequisites for building microservices. Miniservices have less restrictive constraints, allowing teams to work within their current organization without disrupting it, while still improving agility. On the other hand, microservices have stricter guidelines and enable faster delivery, but at a higher cost. Understanding the difference between microservices and miniservices is crucial for leaders to make informed decisions on software architecture."
